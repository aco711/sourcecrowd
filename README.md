# CrowdSense
CrowdSense is a system for universal, context-sensitive, crowdsourced sensemaking aids for a makerspace. CrowdSense allows for communities to contribute to a knowledge base around a subject in the form of notes and questions posted about different machines or stations in a makerspace. The research goal is to study the impact of providing information around complex systems on a user’s ability to familiarize themselves with the space around them. Users of this system may include people with anxiety or communication disorders, or those without intimate understanding of the complex system they’re interacting with.

### Installation
First, install [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/). Then, from your command line, clone this repository and install the necessary npm modules with `npm install`.

This project relies on the projects [React Native Navigation](https://wix.github.io/react-native-navigation/#/installation-ios) and [React Native Beacons Manager](https://github.com/MacKentoch/react-native-beacons-manager). Follow the setup instructions for both of those modules. Once you've done that, you should be able to launch CrowdSense from your command line using the React Native cli: `react-native run ios`.
